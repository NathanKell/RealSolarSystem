// Thanks to GregroxMun!

// Reading this file will probably spoil your experience of science mode in the RSS game.































// Seriously, don't read this. This is the sort of thing that is best experienced in-game.

























//You have had, like, four chances at science configs at this point. Stock configs, Uncharted Lands configs, Alternis Kerbol Rekerjiggered configs, and of course Crowd-Sourced Science Definitions.
//If you spoiled all of those, at least don't spoil this one.



































//You've got one last chance to turn back.




















//If you want some spoiled, here's a sample. Sort of a "trailer" if you will.
//UranusInSpace = Hehehehe. Uranus.
//EarthInSpaceHigh = You're a rocketman, burning out your fuse out here.
//EarthInSpaceLow = Planet Earth is blue, and there's nothing you can do.
//TitanFlyingLow = There's so much air density here you could probably fly a brick, so your spacecraft flies quite nicely.
//HyperionSrfLanded = The dust practically flies off to escape velocity when you try to grab some of it. The planet seems to be held together more magically than gravitationally.
//DeimosInSpace = "Have *you* ever fell around a mountain before?" That is your new comeback to anything ever.
//UranusFlyingLow = Get. Back. In. The. Ship. Before. You. Freeze. Uranus. Off.
//UranusInSpaceHigh = Mission control's message has arrived on schedule. The message: "It's pronounced Ooh-Rahn-Us or Ur-In-Is, got it?"
//There, happy? Not going to spoil it now? Seriously, just play in-game. Please. ;)











































//You seem determined. Fine. You win.
